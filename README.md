# Introduction to Network Analytics with Python

This repository contains the accompanying code and other resources for the IABE training "[CPD: Introduction to Network Analytics with Python](https://iabe.be/trainings/detail/769/cpd-introduction-to-network-analytics-with-python-(01-10-2024))." 
It gives coding examples in `igraph` and `pytorch-geometric` to illustrate the concepts presented during the training. 

The notebook is split into two main parts. The first parts deals with basic concepts, e.g., degree calculation and distribution, implemented in `igraph`. The second part contains code in `pytorch-geometric` to illustrate how network embeddings can be calculated and how to set-up graph neural network architectures. 

The data used for the examples on health care providers can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis).
